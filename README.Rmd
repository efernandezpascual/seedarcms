# *SeedArc*, a global archive of primary seed germination data

This repository stores all information related to the publication *SeedArc, a global archive of primary seed germination data*, including raw data, `R` scripts to process and analyse data, and `Rmarkdown` files to create the manuscript.

Seed germination is a key stage in a plant’s life that is controlled by numerous environmental conditions, but many data on germination-environment relationships remain inaccessible and many plant lineages and biomes are underrepresented. Since available information is scattered into a multitude of sources and germination metrics, there is a need for a unified open-science database to archive and share seed germination data. To meet this need and to stimulate continental and global eco-evolutionary research, we launch SeedArc, a global archive of primary seed germination data (www.unioviedo.es/seedarc/). SeedArc aims to mobilize the wealth of seed germination data that has been produced by decades of studies on seed ecology and conservation. We expect SeedArc to strengthen international collaborative projects in plant science, linking the seed research community with other data synthesis initiatives.

## Contents

This repository is organised following the advice of [Wilson et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510) for recording and storing research projects.

The following materials are available in the folders of this repository:

* `data` Primary data used to create Figure 1.
* `src` Script in `R` language to create Figure 1.
* `doc` Files to create the [manuscript](https://github.com/efernandezpascual/seedarcms/doc/manuscript.md) using `Rmarkdown`.
